# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
Using Python, I analyzed hotel booking data, cleaned it, visualized trends, and predicted cancellations with classification algorithms. Valuable insights for hotel management. 

In this project, I embarked on a journey to analyze hotel booking data and predict cancellation patterns using various machine learning algorithms. The first step involved cleaning the dataset, which was riddled with errors and inconsistencies. Through careful data cleaning techniques, I rectified missing values, corrected formatting issues, and addressed outliers to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

Following data cleaning, I delved into the analysis phase, where I explored booking trends and patterns. This involved visualizing the data to identify factors influencing booking decisions, such as booking lead time, seasonality, and customer demographics. By gaining insights into these trends, I was better equipped to understand customer behaviors and anticipate cancellation tendencies.

Data preprocessing played a crucial role in preparing the dataset for predictive modeling. This included standardizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Normalization techniques were applied to ensure that all features were on a similar scale, preventing any particular feature from dominating the model training process.

For predictive modeling, I employed a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Each algorithm was trained on the cleaned and preprocessed dataset to predict whether a hotel booking would be canceled or not.

The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This allowed me to assess the effectiveness of each algorithm in accurately predicting cancellations. Additionally, I performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize the models and ensure robust performance on unseen data.

The insights generated from the predictive models provide valuable information for hotel management, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their operations. By anticipating cancellation risks, hotels can implement proactive measures to minimize revenue losses, optimize resource allocation, and enhance guest satisfaction.

In conclusion, this project showcases the power of data analysis and machine learning in addressing real-world challenges within the hospitality industry. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, hotels can gain valuable insights into booking behaviors and make strategic decisions to improve their business outcomes.
